# Orange Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict customer behavior to retain valuable customers for Orange Telecom. The goal is to analyze relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs. The predictive models are built using the Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset, which consists of cleaned customer activity data and a churn label specifying whether a customer canceled the subscription.

## Datasets

Two datasets are provided for this project:

1. **churn-bigml-80.csv**
   - Contains 2666 rows (customers) and 20 columns (features).
   - Intended for training and cross-validation purposes.
   - Used for developing machine learning models.

2. **churn-bigml-20.csv**
   - Contains 667 rows (customers) and 20 columns (features).
   - Intended for final testing and model performance evaluation.

The datasets share the same attributes or features, including state, account length, area code, international plan, voice mail plan, number of voicemail messages, total day minutes, total day calls, total day charge, total evening minutes, total evening calls, total evening charge, total night minutes, total night calls, total night charge, total international minutes, total international calls, total international charge, customer service calls, and the churn label.

## Inspiration

This project serves as an opportunity to explore predictive models for customer churn and gain insights into developing effective retention strategies. The analysis and models created here can contribute to the broader understanding of customer behavior in the telecom industry.
